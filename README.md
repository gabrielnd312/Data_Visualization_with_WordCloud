**Hello!**
Here we will know the graph of the "**Word Cloud**" type.

Very useful in evaluating strings and text datasets, where the objective is to find the most common word, phrase, number or letter in the database.


For this, after cleaning the data and filtering, these words are counted and the graph is created where the **most mentioned word** has a larger size, and less mentioned words decrease in this proportion.


To learn a little more about this, as well as a real example and customization methods, please see the **Medium** article and the full code documentation on **Google Colab**.
